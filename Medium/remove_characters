# Challenge: Remove Characters

# The first argument is a path to a file. The file contains the source strings
# and the characters that need to be scrubbed. Each source string and
# characters you need to scrub are delimited by comma.

File.open(ARGV[0]).each_line do |line|
  message,chars = line.split(", ")
  chars = chars.split("")
  chars.each{|x| message.tr!(x,'')}
  puts message
end
